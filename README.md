# Autonomous Warehouse Inventory Management Robot (AGV)

This project aimed to create a warehouse assistive robot controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3B and a Parallax Propeller multicore Microcontroller. The robot was designed to navigate the warehouse and identify defective and non-defective widgets in the warehouse using directional aids and Aruco tag markers respectively.
