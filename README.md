# Autonomous Warehouse Inventory Management Robot (AGV)

This project aimed to create a warehouse assistive robot controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3B and a Parallax Propeller multicore Microcontroller. The robot was designed to navigate the warehouse and identify defective and non-defective widgets in the warehouse using directional aids and Aruco tag markers respectively.

## Introduction

The project encompasses hardware integration, navigation, object identification, electrical connections, and control logic. It involves navigating a predefined map to assist warehouse management in widget identification. The project objectives include accurate line following, intersection detection, handling directional aids, managing widget stations, counting widgets, reaching the docking station, and displaying the total widget count. These objectives guide the robot's functionality.
